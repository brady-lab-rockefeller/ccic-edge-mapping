# Edge mapping for guiding CCIC-based retrieval

## Description

A simple process to index the barcodes of a CCIC clone library to guide
retrieval of target sequences. This script expects Illumina MiSeq paired-end
reads (although it is reasonable to extend to other next-gen read technologies)
for PCR amplicons containing the vector barcode and the edge of a captured
sequence. Amplicons should cover the CCIC barcodes on the R1 (forward) reads.
See publication for details.

*NB:* parts of these scripts may use hardcoded paths or assumptions relevant
only to the data sets used for publication.

The main script is the `bc_otus.sh` BASH script. 

A helper script, `junction_mapping.pl`, is used to recover the reads which were
collapsed into OTUs. It is called by `bc_otus.sh`.

A reference genome is also expected. In this case, a hardcoded path to the S.
albidoflavus J1074 genome is used for the experiment.

## Requirements

- Read data as described above, in a single directory, fastq.gz format
- SeqKit >= 2.1.0
- seqtk >= 1.3-r106
- vsearch >= 2.18.0
- minimap2 >= 2.24-r1122

This script has only been tested on CentOS 7, but should work on most Linux
based systems with a GNU-compatible coreutils.

A conda environment has been provided to ensure all required software is
available. You can use it in conda with:

```bash
conda env create -f ccic-edge-mapping_env.yml -n ccic-edge-mapping
# Or with mamba (much faster)
mamba env create -f ccic-edge-mapping_env.yml -n ccic-edge-mapping
```

## Running

```bash
# Create a workspace directory and cd into it
cd workspace
# Run bc_otus script and give it the path to a directory containing all
# of your read data, in fastq.gz format.
/path/to/ccic-edge-mapping/scripts/bc_otus.sh /path/to/fastqs
# Script will automatically create a symlink to the FASTQ directory and execute
# all steps. It may not stop on some steps if an error occurs.
```

Output will be written to `workspace/minimap2/trimmed_ref_overlaps.sam`, which
can then be visualized in your preferred viewer.
